and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## v4.7.0

### Added

- **`optimize`: `loopify` pass** (on by default) — collapses the canonical
  `while`-loop encoding
  ```
  (block $A (loop $B (br_if $A (i32.eqz cond)) …body… (br $B)))
  ```
  into `(loop $B (if cond (then …body… (br $B))))`. Drops the outer block
  framing, the `br_if`, and a leading `i32.eqz`; trades them for an `if`/`end`.
  Saves ~3 B per while-loop. Only fires when the outer block / loop are both
  void and $A is never targeted from within the body. Skip for typed
  block/loop pairs (preserves a real stack signature).
- **`optimize`: `fold` covers reinterprets and numeric conversions.**
  `(i64.reinterpret_f64 (f64.const …))`, `(f64.convert_i32_s (i32.const …))`
  and friends now fold at compile time — bit-exact (including NaN payloads)
  via `ArrayBuffer`-backed views, so `Math.fround` semantics for f32 are
  preserved. Common in numeric kernels that serialize f64 values through an
  i64 channel (e.g. tagged-pointer schemes).

## v4.6.0

### Added

- **`optimize`: `inlineOnce` pass** (on by default) — inlines functions called
  from exactly one place into their lone caller, then deletes them. Never
  duplicates code and never inflates (drops a func entry, a `call`, and often a type
  entry, paying back only a `block`/`local.set` wrapper); collapses helper chains to
  a fixpoint. Renames the callee's params/locals/labels to avoid shadowing.
- **`optimize`: `mergeBlocks` pass** (on by default) — unwraps untyped
  `(block $L …)` whose label is never branched to, splicing the body into its
  enclosing scope. Tracks label shadowing so an inner `block $L` doesn't mask the
  outer one's use, and skips blocks with `(param …)`/`(result …)`/`(type …)` since
  those imply a real stack signature.
- **`optimize`: `coalesceLocals` pass** (on by default) — shares local slots
  between same-type locals whose live ranges don't overlap. Live ranges are
  computed by a single execution-order walk (children of `local.set`/`local.tee`
  are visited before the set, so a read-then-write inside a set-rhs is correctly
  flagged) and extended to cover any enclosing `loop`. Locals whose first
  reference is a `local.get`, or whose first reference is inside an `if`/`else`
  branch, are never coalesced *into* an existing slot — they would otherwise
  observe the previous occupant's residue instead of the implicit zero / their
  own set on the alternate path.

### Changed

- **`optimize`: `propagate` is now on by default and can no longer inflate.** It
  used to be opt-in because copying a constant to many use sites could *grow* the
  module; now it only ever substitutes (a) a pure single-use local (always shrinks —
  drops the `set`, the lone `get` and the `local` decl) or (b) a constant narrow
  enough that inlining it is byte-neutral at worst. It also descends into nested
  `block`/`loop`/`then`/`else` scopes (so the `(block (result …) (local.set $p arg) …
  (local.get $p))` wrappers `inlineOnce` leaves behind get collapsed), runs a second
  sweep right after the inliners within each round, and correctly drops a tracked
  value once a local it reads is rewritten.
- **`optimize`: round size guard now measures encoded bytes, not AST node count.**
  Passes like `globals` / `inlineOnce` are node-count-neutral yet move real bytes,
  so the old `count()` guard couldn't see them. Each round is now kept only if
  `compile(ast).length` didn't grow (past a small tolerance in non-strict mode); a
  round that produces invalid wat (compile throws) also reverts instead of escaping.
- **`optimize`: `globals` pass is now size-aware.** It used to inline *every*
  immutable global constant unconditionally — turning many cheap `global.get`s
  (~2 B) into fat immediates (`i32.const` up to 4 B, `f64.const` 9 B) and *growing*
  large modules. Now a global is only propagated when `reads·constSize ≤ reads·2 +
  declSize`, and a global whose every read was replaced has its now-dead decl
  removed here too.

### Fixed

- `optimize`: `unbranch` no longer drops the value operand of a trailing
  `(br $L v…)` it removes when the block carries a `(result …)`.

## v4.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- **Default export changed**: `watr` (instant compile+instantiate) replaces `compile`
  ```js
  // v3.x
  import compile from 'watr'
  const binary = compile('(module ...)')

  // v4.x
  import watr from 'watr'
  const { add } = watr`(func (export "add") ...)`  // returns exports!

  // v4.x: to get binary, use named import
  import { compile } from 'watr'
  const binary = compile('(module ...)')
  ```

### Added

- **Template literal API**: `watr\`...\`` for instant WASM functions
- **Auto-import JS functions**: `watr\`(call ${console.log} (i32.const 42))\``
- **Value interpolation**: numbers, BigInts, identifiers, Uint8Arrays, code strings
- **CLI**: `npx watr input.wat` compiles to `.wasm`, `--print`/`--minify` for formatting
- **REPL**: Interactive playground at https://dy.github.io/watr/repl/
- **Error positions**: Line:column in error messages
- **JSDoc**: Comprehensive documentation for all exports
- Parser: Better comment handling with nesting support
- Parser: Depth tracking for unclosed parens/quotes
- Printer: Comment preservation option
- Printer: Proper `try_table` formatting
